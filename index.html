		<p>First task</p>
		<p>Given an array of integers, find the pair of adjacent elements that has the largest product and return that product.</p>

		<p>Example:</p>

		<p>For inputArray = [1, 2, 3, 0], the output should be adjacentElementsProduct(inputArray) = 6.</p>

		<p>2 and 3 produce the largest product.</p>

		<p>More arrays to test [-1, -2] [5, 1, 2, 3, 1, 4] [9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48] [3, 6, -2, -5, 7, 3]</p>

		<p>Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns marking the spaces in a 3X3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.</p>

		<p>But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O" if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".</p>

		<p>A game's result is presented as a list of strings, where "X" and "O" are players' marks and "." is the empty cell.</p>

		<p>Input: A game result as a list of strings (unicode).</p>

		<p>Output: "X", "O" or "D" as a string.</p>

		<p>Precondition:</p>

		<p>There is either one winner or a draw.</p>

		<p>Do not use regular expressions!</p>
		
		<p>With the example - ["XXX","XOX","OOX"]</p>
